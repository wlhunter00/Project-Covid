Our diverse team comprises students with credible experiences in healthcare, health literacy, and technology. Our iOS and Android apps come loaded with live outbreak trackers, testing center information, breaking news stories from verified sources, live travel information, along with verified information on best practices, knowledge about the virus, educational toolkits, student resources, and crisis contact information.",
